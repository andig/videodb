INSTALL

  - Be sure to have a recent PHP version! At least 5.3 with GD library is required
  - copy all files in a directory somewhere below your webserver root
  
  Do one of these steps:

    -  point your browser the install.php and follow the instructions

  or (not recommended since v2.0)

    - create a MySQL-Database using the table definitions in
      install/install.sql
    - edit the config.inc.php to match your database

  - point your browser to your new VideoDB and add some movies
  - customize everything in the config screen

UPDATING FROM A PRIOR VERSION

  - extract the new videoDB archive into the same folder as your old installation
  - open videoDB- the system will recognize that upgrade is required and start install.php
  
  or

    - manually point your browser to install.php
    
  - follow the instructions

  or (not recommended since v2.0)

    - run doc/updatedb.sql over your existing database with the -f option to
      force mysql to ignore errors. This *should* not delete any of your data.
      e.g.
        mysql -p -f VideoDB < doc/updatedb.sql

  - check out new config options in the config screen

CUSTOMIZING

  - You can define up to four custom fields in the config screen
  - You can add input and output functions for them in custom.php
  - You can add additional stylesheets by dropping them into the template
    directory (e.g. templates/default/)
  - You can create your own templates by putting them into their own
    directory in templates/
  - Whenever you do anything of the above please send it to me
