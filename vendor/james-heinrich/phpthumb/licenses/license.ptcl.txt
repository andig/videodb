                 =============================

phpThumb() is licensed under the "GNU Public License" (GPL) and/or the
"phpThumb() Commercial License" (pTCL). This document describes the pTCL.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The license is non-exclusively granted to a single person or company,
per payment of the license fee, for the lifetime of that person or
company. The license is non-transferrable.

The pTCL grants the licensee the right to use phpThumb() in commercial
closed-source projects. Modifications may be made to phpThumb() with no
obligation to release the modified source code. phpThumb() (or pieces
thereof) may be included in any number of projects authored (in whole
or in part) by the licensee.

The licensee may use any version of phpThumb(), past, present or future,
as is most convenient. This license does not entitle the licensee to
receive any technical support, updates or bugfixes, except as such are
made publicly available to all phpThumb() users.

The licensee may not sub-license phpThumb() itself, meaning that any
commercially released product containing all or parts of phpThumb() must
have added functionality beyond what is available in phpThumb();
phpThumb() itself may not be re-licensed by the licensee.
